### Hi There! I'm Jesse ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack machine learning (ML) engineer currently working as an engineering/ML consultant at my own business. I'm comfortable working on the frontend, backend, and developing and deploying machine learning algorithms reliably.  

On the side, I really enjoy writing, creating content, teaching, and helping people understand (potentially) difficult concepts. I try to create educational content centered around machine learning, software engineering, productivity, and more.
