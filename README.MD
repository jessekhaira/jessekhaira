### Hi There! I'm Jesse ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack machine learning engineer that transitioned to tech after graduating from university as a chemical engineer. 

I'm currently working at my own business as a technology consultant, specializing in production machine learning, but comfortable working anywhere on the stack. 

On the side, I really enjoy writing, creating content, and teaching. I specifically try to create helpful educational content centered around:
- ðŸ’¡ Sharing useul insights I've gained from my own experiences
- ðŸ“– Self-learning & transitioning to tech
- ðŸ¤– Simplifying complicated technical concepts 

I also really enjoy providing help to anyone transitioning into web development and/or machine learning from another field, especially for individuals considering or currently pursuing the self-learning path. If this is you, please don't hestitate to reach out, I'd love to help! :)
